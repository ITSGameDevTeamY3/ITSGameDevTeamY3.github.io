  about:             |
    I am a Games Development student currently studying my third year at IT Sligo. 
    I have a keen interest in video games as a medium and would consider myself an aficionado of video game soundtracks (OSTs).
    
    Highly proficient in spelling and grammar from an early age, I am now focused on improving my programming and problem-solving skills both through coursework and during my free time.
    Known to take work seriously, I like to ensure it is done well and on-time. I Have a lot of experience with C# programming in GameMaker and MonoGame. 
    I am currently getting to grips with the Unity engine.
