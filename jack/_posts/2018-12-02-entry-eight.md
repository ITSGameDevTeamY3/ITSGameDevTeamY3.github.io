This past week's been another quiet one thanks to numerous assignments, exams and deadlines to contend with. For Project D I mostly just experimented with adding new 3D Models like props or buildings
 into the scene. I also toyed with putting some textures onto my protomap to make it look a little more presentable. Next week's the big one though, so I'd prefer to talk about that.

## Next Week

Our demo for this project is on the Thursday of this week, the 6th of December, so the days leading up to it will be quite hectic I feel. We essentially need a working prototype that will show off the
 gameplay that we are going for in this game. Currently we have a level ready and an enemy half-ready. 

Here's what I estimate we'll need for this demo:
*  A controllable player operated from a third person view. It should be able to jump and attack as well as move freely.
*  An enemy with all of his phases working at least rudimentarily.
*  The enemy should be able to detect, shoot at the player, and die.
*  There should be a boundary placed beneath the stage that will respawn the player/restart the level if the player falls and touches it.
*  There should be a start point where the player will always spawn.
*  There should be a goal point where the level will end/restart once the player reaches it. (Assuming they've defeated enough enemies.)

If we can manage to include most or all of these elements in our demo, we should be golden. Now, the preparation begins.

See you on the other side!
