description: >
  Here I briefly talk about my research into Unity's NavMesh functionality. This will be a shorter post than last week's.

Since my main task for the time being is that of the enemies and their AI, this week I spent time researching
 Unity's NavMesh functionality on the [Unity User Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Navigation.html).
 Unity's NavMesh allows you to auto-generate a visible map on top of your scene geometry, this map appears as a blue highlight
 over the ground. Anything covered in the blue highlight can be traversed by the NavMesh Agent you've assigned. An enemy in your scene
 is a good example of a potential NavMesh Agent. 
 
Over the week I read through the entirety of Unity's documentation on Navigation and Pathfinding. 
 Having read through it all by the 24th I then installed Unity's [NavMeshComponents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/NavMeshComponents) into our project.
 These components are necessary for customising your NavMesh, for example, you can set specific regions to be "Not Walkable"
 or modify them to only be accessible by a certain type of enemy.

 As a quick aside, to help Adrian work on sound effects for the game, I drew up quick "SFX Screenshots"
 to give him an idea of the sounds needed for the game. Simply put, these are screenshots of the proto-map
 with directions as to what sounds could inhabit a certain environment in the game. They can be seen below.

## SFX Screenshots

*   Green  - Environment sounds
*   Purple - A "Zone" where a sound can be heard continuously
*   Red    - Player actions
*   Blue   - Enemy actions

The sounds that would be heard in the starting area.

If we decide to add a short route inside this tunnel opening, we could add reverb to all of the sounds heard within.

The clearing where a number of sounds may be heard.

That's what I've managed to get done for this week, mostly research, since it's been a busy one.

'Til next time.
