## What is Project Dissonance?

Project Dissonance is a third-person stealth game developed on the Unity Engine. We first conceived the game in May 2018. Our first meeting involved a lot of brainstorming for ideas, the main goal for this meeting was to decide upon something that each of us would want to work on.

Eventually, after our second meeting in May, we settled on the idea of a stealth game with a post-apocalyptic cyberpunk setting. This stealth game concept was inspired by popular stealth action franchises like [Tenchu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenchu) and [Metal Gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear). 

After much deliberation, we also decided on the art style of the game: cel-shaded visuals along with anthropomorphic character designs. We felt that both of these elements would set our game apart from the rest and leave an impression on the player. A good example of anthropomorphic character designs can be seen in popular game franchises like [Ratchet & Clank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_%26_Clank) and [Sly Cooper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sly_Cooper), the latter of which also happens to be fall into the stealth game genre.

By the end of May 2018, we had a solid concept of what our game would be. 

### **To put it simply:**

**Project Dissonance is a third person stealth game with a post-apocalyptic cyberpunk setting developed on the Unity Engine. It will feature characters of an anthropomorphic design, brought to life with vibrant cel-shaded visuals.** 

## From Inception to Now

Our first order of business was to come up with a name for our team. Initially we had decided on the name Occultist Games, over time however, we felt that we could come up with something better. After each of us proposed a potential name, we voted and decided upon the name “Killing Spraoi”.

We also decided upon each member’s roles in the project early on. They are as follows:

*   David    - Programming, Character Design, Gameplay, Narrative/Scenario, Project Blog
*   Jack     - Programming, Narrative/Scenario, Environment/Level Design, Documentation
*   Adrian   - Soundtrack, sound effects, FMOD functionality in Unity
*	Donnacha - Character Design, Modelling, In-game Assets

Over the Summer of 2018, our artists/designers David and Donnacha came up with a lot of concepts for character designs as well as logos for both our team name and the game itself. The logos have since been finalised. The final designs can be seen below.

We are still creating concepts for both the protagonist and the antagonists, here are some examples:




```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this. Or is it?
