Where did the name for the project come from? 

## The Name ‘Project Dissonance’
A good question. It was when Jack, Donnacha, Adrian and I were walking out from our meeting in the campus library in May of our 2nd year, prior to summer. We all had discussed over our thoughts of making the game a **hack 'n slash stealth** game. 

I remember Adrian and Jack stressed to me how important it was to get the balance right between stealth and action. They noted that there may be ‘_dissonance_’ between the two conflicting genres. I thought that back over to myself and said ‘hey, that's a neat word, it would fit for the name’ and it stuck. This is a project of **dissonance**, in its own story and gameplay. A challenge we as a team will face and be aware of throughout development.

### In the Past
As Jack has detailed in his introduction post, in our first meeting we brainstormed the plan for our final project early.

This is an image taken from my phone of one of the first brainstorms we came up with for the project. We found a room in the C Block on campus, went in and let creativity take us by surprise. I bought whiteboard markers that I have somewhere at home in Mullingar since then, fun to look back on.

We have sat down as a group and have collaborated in project management classes to define what our goals for the project are. What takes priority and what we need to focus on. Lean-thinking.

## Until Now

- Done a ton of research into gameplay mechanics.
- Wrote a segment on Jack's story synopsis for Project Dissonance.
- Helped out formatting the project proposal.
- I have set up and designed this blog.
- I have sketched out the first few concepts for the characters.
- I recently completed fully rendered 2D weapon designs.
- Jack and I have worked closely on maintaining the Trello board for our team.

## What I Will Focus On This Week

- Finishing character design & environmental concepts is my **immediate** concern right now.
- Setup Unity scene and create code structure for a base player.
- Implement the code basis for _sight-jacking_.
- Do a bit of research to brush up on 3D modelling.
- Get into Maya 3D and perhaps take on a few test models to import to Unity.
