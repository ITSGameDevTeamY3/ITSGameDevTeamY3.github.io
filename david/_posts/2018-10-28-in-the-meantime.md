I had forgot to document the weapon designs I came up with earlier two weeks back. I will post them here.

## Protagonist Blade Design

I had sat down one evening and sketched out these weapon concepts. I made sure that they had a scrap metal 
look to them while also maintaining Donnacha's style of a tonfa blade. I took inspiration from **Xenoblade Chronicles**, 
**Final Fantasy** and **Shinmai Fukei Kiruko-san** manga.

I followed feedback from the team, friends and family. They all chose their favourite, the popular one being the design below.

This is the finalized 2D render of the blade in color to match the protagonist.

The blade allows attacks from both ends and is allowed to be held either from the tonfa grip or the traditional blade handle.
The highlighted colors on the blade indicate a power source, that surges through it and also through the main character.
I personally feel it may enhance the acceleration or speed of the blade as its trail will leave behind a streak of blinding green
at the light sources.
