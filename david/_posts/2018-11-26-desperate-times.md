Progress this week has been slightly sluggish as we wrote a massive _18 page_ report for Professional Development on _The 
Study of Unique AI & Pathfinding in Games_.
I'm still currently working on the player model in **Maya 2018** and will construct a full blog post on the process of that 
next week.

## Out of Hours Campus Work Update
This weekend, I've had to take initiative and bring all of my equipment here to Sligo. This is all thanks to the security 
department that won't allow access for final year students to work on weekends. To add to this mess, the IT Services have 
managed to do nothing over the course of last week to fix any of the hard-drives in the computer labs or grant us much needed 
admin-privileges.

Personally I don't think either of these problems can be excused, both are five minute jobs. It's a shame that they are out of our 
control. The college is disappointing with its lack of services for students who want to do that essential bit extra.

## My Current Setup
Enough ranting aside, the bedroom is where I will make the work happen from now on. The computer I'm using now belongs to my 
brother and I, we pitched in funds for parts and I put it all together. It has mostly the same specifications as the ones on campus 
so it should work nicely for when coding in Unity and modelling in Maya.

Adrian helped me carry my monitor up to Sligo. Thanks Adrian. <3{:.figure}

## Tasks This Week
The tasks will remain the same as last week. Two weeks overdue, I know. Until next time!
