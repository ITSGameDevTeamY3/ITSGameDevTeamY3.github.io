  Sometimes, you need time to breathe a little. To gather your thoughts and give them room.

The midterm break was one spent with rest after an intense few weeks of finalizing concepts and settling discussions.
The pressure this year is _immense_ compared to last year. I found myself feeling that I had more time last year 
than what we are given now. It's interesting how much pressure can have an affect on your morale.

## Before The Midterm
I can conclude that we have done excellent work in bringing our minds together as a team and coming up with universe 
we can call our own. I have confidence that we know exactly what we want to create and an experience to deliver. I can safely say we
are focused and are pushing our creativity in the right direction. Everything is coming together in my head, equally from each team member.
There is a chance with enough time and effort that we can surpass any of our expectations.

## Dissonance Brawl
Before our midterm break began, we were landed with another side project to do as an assignment for two of our modules. 
This will be tough to manage however we decided it would be a good idea to combine both projects in some way to ease the 
amount of work required. This took the form of _Dissonance Brawl_, a smash game in vain to Nintendo's **Super Smash Bros.**

This way we can use our assets for both our games!
I quickly redesigned our logos and we now have a smash counterpart to our Project Dissonance series of sorts.

The main title, now with a cleaner look in frost blue to help make the wolf head stand out more.

This version has an opposite blood red variant with a touch of pink. The brawl text is brushed below in an oriental touch.

## After The Midterm
Thankfully, after this mid-term break my motivation will be at all time high to implement everything we have learned and 
researched to finally bog down into some code. This time will be spent in Unity for the most part, especially in the last few weeks.
We have to keep in mind we only have 5 weeks to make things happen for the presentation and we are all aware of this.
