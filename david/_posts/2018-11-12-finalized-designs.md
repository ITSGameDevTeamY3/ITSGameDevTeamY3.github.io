This week was a rush to get as much character concepts completed. I may not have them all done but it serves as a lesson to not 
over-analyze things. I will most likely come back to them when I have more time but I must get to other tasks that are more 
important to get done. Assets we have learned are a constant thing to be worked on and take quite some time and energy to produce.

## Scientist Concept

The scientist is currently planned to be the first boss of the game. When I designed this character, I wanted to communicate the
evil emotions of greed and madness for his research in science. I used many references for this character and was inspired by _Hojo_
from **Final Fantasy VII**, _Dr. K_ from **Changed**, character design works from **Kuroblood** along with designs from the 
fictional universe **Empire of the New Sun**.

I had spent a lot of time thinking of how this character would think, talk and act and I have a very strong understanding of how
he would interact and belong in this world. He has a high position of intelligence in the **Eclipse Mountain Complex**, wearing his
own armband to represent his loyal rank of scientist in the factions color of dominance.

I wanted the scientist to have long hair and strong features, wrinkles with a long snout. His glasses are rounded in an old fashioned style.

## Scientist Design

The finalized design of the scientist. His weapon of choice is a syringe, with sharp obtrusions for extra grip on his patients.

As you may have noticed, the color of the liquid inside the syringe matches that of the protagonist's dominant. Whether these two 
are related is yet to be discussed.
