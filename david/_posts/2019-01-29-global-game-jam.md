I didn't get to work on Project Dissonance itself over the Christmas break.
I have been working with Unity quite a bit however despite this and have learned a lot of new things.

## Experience Gained

### Dissonance Brawl
We as a team worked on the assignment for our Casual Games assignment and in the end, it all turned out ok. 
I learned how to get to grips with materials, bump-mapping and specular. On top of this I coded a fully functioning Smash Bros. camera!
I made good use of my new _Git_ client **GitKraken** also, with it I can view and make changes in greater detail.
GitKraken as a whole makes source control with Unity a whole lot easier to manage with _merge remote tracking_ commits.
The repository stands with a total of 99 commits, I know it's no true measurement but that's an impressive number to me at least !

### Global Game Jam 2019
Yes! I participated in my first Global Game Jam. The product of my entry was a homage to my Cry of Fear Halloween Collaboration back in 2012.
It's a very short tech demo called **Threat**, where I got to learn some really cool stuff that will prove to be extremely useful in Project Dissonance.
This includes _post-processing_ effects, _volumetric lighting_ and advanced lighting techniques.
You can check it out here.
